Upon entering a village in the Al-Jabal region, it is customary to be greeted with the playing of drums and singing of poems announcing the guest’s arrival. Following this, a lottery is conducted to decide who will be awarded the honor of hosting the guest. From there, the guest is taken into the home and immediately treated as if they were family. And while these are people of little means, they still somehow manage to serve a feast, provide lodging, and fulfill any and every request someone may have. High in the mountains and deep in those valleys where coffee was first cultivated nearly half a millennia ago, it is truly something both ancient, marvelous and magical to behold. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePort of Mokha has been on the ground in Al-Jabal longer than any other region we work in and it most definitely shows.
