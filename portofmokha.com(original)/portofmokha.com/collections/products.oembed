While our partner estates undoubtedly produce exceptional coffees, Al-Khanshali I is the only estate that we have complete control over each step in the production. Located in West Haraz, it's both accessible and desirable for its unique microclimate and extreme high elevation. Our future plans for this flagship farm include an onsite coffee lab, a complete processing facility and an onsite mill. This farm gives us an unprecedented opportunity for experimental processing techniques, genetic R\u0026amp;D and so much more. We couldn't be more excited for this project to take shape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAl-Khanshali III, located in West Haraz, is both unique and excellent for a number of reasons. First, the Haraz region—of all the coffee producing regions in Yemen—has easily the most experience producing high quality, traceable coffee. Our work would have never been possible if it weren't for the vision and dedication of Bohra communities of Eastern Haraz who built mills, collection centers, and many other vital coffee infrastructure before anyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eTrilogy Box Flavor Profiles\u003c\/i\u003e\u003c\/b\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl-Khanshali I: Lot 17 (Sundried Natural) – Peach Nectar, Honey, Clove.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eAl-\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eKhanshali III: Lot 10 (Sundried Natural) \u003c\/span\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e– Prune, Mango, Palm Sugar\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAl-Khanshali I: Lot 2 (9 Days Anaerobic) \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e–\u003c\/span\u003e Passion Fruit, Rum, Baking Spice \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor international orders, Port of Mokha is not liable for custom fees.

Upon entering a village in the Al-Jabal region, it is customary to be greeted with the playing of drums and singing of poems announcing the guest’s arrival. Following this, a lottery is conducted to decide who will be awarded the honor of hosting the guest. From there, the guest is taken into the home and immediately treated as if they were family. And while these are people of little means, they still somehow manage to serve a feast, provide lodging, and fulfill any and every request someone may have. High in the mountains and deep in those valleys where coffee was first cultivated nearly half a millennia ago, it is truly something both ancient, marvelous and magical to behold. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePort of Mokha has been on the ground in Al-Jabal longer than any other region we work in and it most definitely shows.
